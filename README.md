# Omnistack10: project of `devRadar`

 Project of the OmniStack season 10: A radar of Developers. Using NodeJS in backend, ReactJS in Frontend and React Native for mobile integration.

## [Backend](/backend/): NodeJS

Uses `express`, `axios`, `mongoose` & `cors` modules to make it possible to work locally, @ development. Uses mongoDB, with integration to  [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/general/) starting with online database.

Proposed challenges: .update() & .destroy() methods to deal with info with MongoDB.

Tried to deploy it inside Netlify: https://devradar-backend-api.netlify.com

## [Frontend](/web/): ReactJS

Starting with [`create-react-app`]() to set up the environment and then adding `axios` to connect with backend server.

Thoughts: create a way to use at frontend the challenges proposed to the backend implementation.
